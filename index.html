      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>"Why settle for snake oil when you can have the whole snake!"</p>
      <p>Python is a truly wonderful language. When somebody comes up with a good idea it takes about
         1 minute and five lines to program something that almost does what you want. Then it takes only an hour to extend 
         the script to 300 lines, after which it still does almost what you want.

    <h3>Deployment</h3>
    <p>"When in doubt about what to write, sometimes a good quote is all you need to send."</p>
    <p>Deploying a project using Git and GitHub involves leveraging Git for version control and GitHub as a remote repository
       hosting service. This process starts with initializing a local Git repository to track project changes.
        After committing your work locally, 
      you create a corresponding repository on GitHub, which serves as a centralized location for your code.
